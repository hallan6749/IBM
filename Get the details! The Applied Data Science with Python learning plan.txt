The Applied Data Science with Python learning plan

Is this a good match for you and your job role interests?
Data is comprised of bits and bytes, and as humans, we are immersed in data in our everyday lives. The value that data holds can only be understood when we can start to identify patterns and trends within the data that then trigger questions to better understand the impact of our actions.

Are you an aspiring data scientist who wants to learn data science hands-on?

Do you want to learn how to use the Python language to clean, analyze, and visualize data?

Then, this Applied Data Science with Python learning plan is for you!

You will learn how to code in Python for data science, then analyze and visualize data with Python with packages like scikit-learn, matplotlib, and bokeh.
There are guided lectures and labs to provide you with hands-on experience tackling interesting data problems.
This is an action-packed learning plan for data science enthusiasts who want to work with real-world problems using Python.
This learning path will help you solidify your data skills in Python before diving into machine learning, big data, and deep learning in Python.
Come along and start your learning plan of three courses to receive a series of IBM-issued badges.

Applied Data Science with Python learning plan

What should you know before taking this course?
Prerequisites

Basic skills in programing, preferably Python
Some mathematical skills from basic university or advanced high school or  basic statistics
Recommended skills prior to taking this course

Some knowledge with Python libraries: Numpy, Pandas, and scikit-learn
Some experience with a Jupyter notebook
Data Visualization with Python
About the course
Data visualization is the graphical representation of data in order to interactively and efficiently convey insights to clients, customers, and stakeholders in general. It is a way to summarize your findings and display it in a form that facilitates interpretation and can help in identifying patterns or trends. In this course, you'll learn how to create interesting graphics and charts and customize them to make them more effective and more pleasing to your audience.

The duration is 10 hours.

Badge
Earn the Data Visualization using Python badge issued by IBM when you complete this course.

What will you learn?
This is an intermediate-level, self-paced course that includes videos, labs, graded review questions, and a final exam.

One of the key skills of a data scientist is the ability to tell a compelling story, visualizing data and findings in an approachable and stimulating way. Learning how to leverage a software tool to visualize data will also enable you to extract information, better understand the data, and make more effective decisions.

The main goal of this course is to teach you how to take data that at first glance has little meaning and present that data in a form that makes sense to people. Various techniques have been developed for presenting data visually but in this course, we will be using several data visualization libraries in Python, namely Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium.

Modules

Module 1: Introduction to Visualization Tools
Module 2: Basic Visualization Tools
Module 3: Specialized Visualization Tools
Module 4: Extra Visualization Tools
Module 5: Creating Maps and Visualizing Geospatial Data
