You can start it at any time and you can take as long as you need to complete it. Your place in the course will be remembered and your labs will be saved. However, we strongly recommend that you don't take prolonged breaks between lessons as the mind tends to forget what it does not practice.

This is a hands-on course where you will gain practical skill by doing hands-on labs. We provide a a complete virtual lab environment on the cloud that you can access from anywhere as long as you have internet connection.

You can watch videos and read course materials on a mobile device. However, you will likely need to use a computer for hands on labs as small screen size and lack of keyboard make mobile devices a poor choice for hands on labs.
