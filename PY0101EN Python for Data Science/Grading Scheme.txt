Grading Scheme
The minimum passing mark for the course is 70% with the following weights:
50% - All Review Questions 
50% - The Final Exam
Though Review Questions and the Final Exam have a passing mark of 50% respectively, the only grade that matters is the overall grade for the course.
Review Questions have no time limit. You are encouraged to review the course material to find the answers.  Please remember that the Review Questions are worth 50% of your final mark.
The final exam has a 1 hour time limit.
Attempts are per question in both, the Review Questions and the Final Exam:
One attempt - For True/False questions
Two attempts - For any question other than True/False
There are no penalties for incorrect attempts.
Clicking the "Final Check" button when it appears, means your submission is FINAL.  You will NOT be able to resubmit your answer for that question ever again.
Check your grades in the course at any time by clicking on the "Progress" tab.
